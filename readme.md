# Roundabout

This fork of [jQuery Roundabout](https://github.com/fredleblanc/roundabout) allows you to define the depth of elements visible. It retains all the options of the original plugin.

## Usage

Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/fredleblanc/roundabout) for instructions.

## Depth option

To understand how it works add the option to your roundabout.

```
$('ul').roundabout({
    depth:2
});
```
